# Track A: iOS-style SSH Implementation and UI Improvements

## Summary

This MR implements a production-ready SSH connection management system with an iOS-style user experience. The implementation focuses on zero-configuration usability while maintaining flexibility for advanced users.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🎯 SSH Configuration Management
- **SSHConfigManager**: Persistent configuration storage using UserDefaults
- Smart defaults: localhost connection with current system username
- Support for password and SSH key authentication
- Recent hosts memory for quick reconnection

### 📱 iOS-Style Settings Interface  
- Native SwiftUI settings panel with grouped sections
- Real-time connection testing with visual feedback
- Password/key management with secure field toggles
- File browser integration for SSH key selection

### 🖥️ Enhanced Terminal Experience
- **Command Output Display**: Full command history with stdout/stderr
- **Terminal Escape Sequence Filtering**: Clean output without iTerm2/ANSI noise
- **Auto-scrolling**: Automatic scroll to latest output
- **Text Selection**: All output text is selectable and copyable

### 🔧 SSH Execution Improvements
- **Login Shell Semantics**: Commands run with full user environment (PATH, aliases, etc.)
- **Universal Command Support**: brew, node, npm, and custom tools work out-of-the-box
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures and command errors

### 🚀 Zero-Configuration Experience
- No environment variables required
- Default to localhost connection
- Automatic shell detection (zsh → bash → sh fallback)
- No crashes or hangs in any configuration state

        └── TerminalView.swift          # Modified: Command output display
```

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Login Shell Wrapper**: All SSH commands are wrapped with `$SHELL -lic` to ensure full environment loading
2. **Escape Sequence Sanitization**: RegEx-based cleaning of OSC 1337 and ANSI CSI sequences  
3. **@MainActor Configuration**: SSHConfigManager is MainActor-bound for SwiftUI compatibility
4. **Sendable Compliance**: Proper handling of SwiftNIO SSH's non-Sendable warnings

## Testing Performed

- ✅ Basic commands: `ls`, `pwd`, `whoami`
- ✅ Package managers: `brew -v`, `node -v`, `npm -v`  
- ✅ Error cases: invalid commands, disconnected state
- ✅ UI interactions: settings, connection toggle, text selection
- ✅ Persistence: settings survive app restart

## Screenshots

_(Would include actual screenshots in a real MR)_

1. Main terminal view with command output
2. Settings panel showing SSH configuration
3. Connection status indicators
4. Command execution with clean output

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- MockSSHManager remains functional for testing
- Environment variables are ignored in favor of UserDefaults

## Future Enhancements (Not in this MR)

- [ ] PTY allocation for interactive commands
- [ ] ANSI color preservation and rendering
- [ ] SSH key generation within the app
- [ ] Connection profiles/bookmarks
- [ ] Command history persistence

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] No runtime crashes in default configuration
- [ ] UI is responsive and follows iOS patterns
- [ ] SSH connections work with common servers
- [ ] Documentation is updated where needed

## Related Issues

- Implements Track A requirements from parallel development plan
- Addresses SSH connection stability and usability concerns
- Provides foundation for future Track B AI enhancements
