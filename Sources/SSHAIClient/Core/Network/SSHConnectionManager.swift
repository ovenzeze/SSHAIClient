/// It provides async APIs for connecting to a host, executing commands, and disconnecting.
///
/// Input/Output conventions:
/// - All public async APIs return typed result objects or throw typed errors.
/// - Connection identifiers are UUIDs returned by `connect` and must be passed to subsequent calls.
/// - This manager is thread-safe for public APIs via internal synchronization.
///
/// Not implemented on purpose:
/// - Actual NIO/NIOSSH channel bootstrap and pipeline wiring
/// - Host key verification, keyboard-interactive, agent forwarding
/// - Streamed output (stdout/stderr) and PTY resizing
///
/// Extension points:
/// - Add delegate/callback for streaming output
/// - Inject credential provider, host key verifier, metrics logger
